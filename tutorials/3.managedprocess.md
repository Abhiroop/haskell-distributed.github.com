### Introduction

In order to explore the `ManagedProcess` API, we will present a simple
example taken from the test suite, which exercises some of the more
interesting features.

Let's imagine we want to execute tasks on an arbitrary node, using a
mechanism much as we would with the `call` API from distributed-process.
As with `call`, we want the caller to block whilst the remote task is
executing, but we also want to put an upper bound on the number of
concurrent tasks. We will use `ManagedProcess` to implement a generic
task server with the following characteristics

* requests to enqueue a task are handled immediately
* callers will block until the task completes (or fails)
* an upper bound is placed on the number of concurrent running tasks

Once the upper bound is reached, tasks will be queued up for later
execution, and only when we drop below the limit will tasks be taken
from the backlog and executed.

`ManagedProcess` provides a basic protocol for *server-like* processes
such as this, based on the synchronous `call` and asynchronous `cast`
functions. Although `call` is synchronous, communication with the
*server process* is out of band, both from the client and the server's
point of view.
