### Help

If the documentation doesn't answer your question, queries about Cloud Haskell
can be directed to the Parallel Haskell Mailing List
(parallel-haskell@googlegroups.com), which is pretty active. If you think
you've found a bug, or would like to request a new feature, please visit the
[Jira Issue Tracker](https://cloud-haskell.atlassian.net) and submit a bug.
You **will** need to register with your email address to create new issues,
though you can freely browse the existing tickets without doing so.


### Getting Involved

If you're interested in hacking Cloud Haskell then please read the
[Contributing](/wiki/contributing.html) wiki page. Additional help can be obtained through the
[Developers Forum/Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/cloud-haskell-developers)
or Parallel Haskell mailing list.
